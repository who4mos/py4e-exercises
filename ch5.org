* Write a program which repeatedly reads numbers until the  user enters “done”. Once “done” is entered, print out the total, count, and average of the numbers. If the user enters anything other than a number, detect their mistake using try and except and print an error message and skip to the next number.

#+begin_src python
  answer = str()
  total = 0
  count = 0

  while answer.lower() != "done":
      answer = input("Enter a number: ")

      try:
	  number = float(answer)
      except:
	  print("Please, enter a number.")
	  continue

      count += 1
      total += number

  average = total / count

  print(f"Total: {total}")
  print(f"Count: {count}")
  print(f"Average: {average}")
#+end_src

* Write another program that prompts for a list of numbers as above and at the end prints out both the maximum and minimum of the numbers instead of the average.

#+begin_src python
  answer = str()
  big = None
  small = None

  while answer.lower() != "done":
      answer = input("Enter a number: ")

      try:
	  number = int(answer)
      except:
	  print("Please, enter a number.")
	  continue

      if big is None or number > big:
	  big = number
        
      if small is None or number < small:
	  small = number
        
  print(f"Max: {big}")
  print(f"Min: {small}")
#+end_src
