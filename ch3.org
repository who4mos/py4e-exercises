* Rewrite your pay computation to give the employee 1.5 times the hourly rate for hours worked above 40 hours.

#+begin_src python
  hours = int(input("Hours: "))
  rate = float(input("Rate: "))

  if hours > 40:
	pay = 40 * rate + (hours - 40) * 1.5 * rate
  else:
      pay = hours * rate

  print(f"Pay: {pay}")
#+end_src

* Rewrite your pay program using try and except so that your program handles non-numeric input gracefully by printing a message and exiting the program.

#+begin_src python
  try:
      hours = int(input("Hours: "))
      rate = float(input("Rate: "))
  except:
      print("Error, please enter numeric input")
      exit()

  if hours > 40:
      pay = 40 * rate + (hours - 40) * 1.5 * rate
  else:
      pay = hours * rate

  print(f"Pay: {pay}")
#+end_src

* Write a program to prompt for a score between 0.0 and 1.0. If the score is out of range, print an error message. If the score is between 0.0 and 1.0, print a grade using the following table:

| Score  | Grade |
| >= 0.9 | A     |
| >= 0.8 | B     |
| >= 0.7 | C     |
| >= 0.6 | D     |
| < 0.6  | F     |

#+begin_src python
try:
    score = float(input("Enter score (0.0-1.0): "))
except:
    print("Bad score")
    exit()

if score < 0 or score > 1:
    print("Bad score")
    exit() 
    
if score >= .9:
    grade = 'A'
elif score >= .8:
    grade = 'B'
elif score >= .7:
    grade = 'C'
elif score >= .6:
    grade = 'D'
else:
    grade = 'F'

print(f"Grade: {grade}")
