* Write a simple program to simulate the operation of the grep command on Unix. Ask the user to enter a regular expression and count the number of lines that matched the regular expression:

#+begin_src python
  import re

  regex = input("Enter a regular expression: ")
  fname = input("Enter a file name: ")

  try:
      fhandle = open(fname)
  except:
      print(f"File could not be opened: {fname}")
      exit()

  matches =  0

  for line in fhandle:
      if re.search(regex, line):
	  matches += 1

  print(f"{fname} had {matches} lines that matched {regex}")
#+end_src

* Write a program to look for lines of the form:

: New Revision: 39772

Extract the number from each of the lines using a regular expression and the findall() method. Compute the average of the numbers and print out the average as an integer.

#+begin_src python
  import re

  fname = input("Enter a file name: ")

  try:
      fhandle = open(fname)
  except:
      print(f"File could not be opened: {fname}")
      exit()

  regex = r"^New Revision: ([0-9]+)"
  nums =  list()

  for line in fhandle:
      n = re.findall(regex, line)
      if n:
	  nums.extend(n)

  nums = [int(n) for n in nums]

  avg = sum(nums) / len(nums)

  print(int(avg))
#+end_src
