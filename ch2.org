* Type the following statements in the Python interpreter to see what they do:

#+begin_src python
  5     # output: 5
  x = 5 # no output
  x + 1 # output: 6
#+end_src

* Write a program that uses ~input~ to prompt a user for their name  and then  welcomes them.

#+begin_src python
  name = input("Enter your name: ")
  print("Hello " + name)
#+end_src

* Write a program to prompt the user four hours and rate per hour to compute gross pay.

#+begin_src python
  hours = int(input("Enter Hours: "))
  rate = float(input("Enter Rate: "))

  pay = hours * rate

  print("Pay:", round(pay, 2))
#+end_src

* Assume that we execute the following assignment statements:

#+begin_src python
  width = 17
  height = 12.0
#+end_src

For each of the following expressions, write the value of the expression and the type (of the value of the expression).

- ~width//2~ ::
  8 (int)

- ~width/2.0~ ::
  8.5 (float)

- ~height/3~ ::
  4.0 (float)

- ~1 + 2 * 5~ ::
  11 (int)
  
* Write a program which prompts the user for a Celsius temperature, convert the temperature to Fahrenheit, and print out the converted temperature.

#+begin_src python
  celcius = float(input("Enter temperature in celcius: "))

  fahr =  (celcius  * 9/5) + 32

  print("In fahrenheit:", round(fahr, 2))
#+end_src
